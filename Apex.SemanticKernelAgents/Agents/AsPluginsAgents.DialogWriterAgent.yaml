  Process each verbal action in [Verbal actions] list until all verbal actions are fully processed by following the next steps:
   1. Identify multiple applicable assistants in the current verbal action.
   2. Invoke all assistants, one by one, in the identified assistants list in the previous step, and let them generate dialog lines.
  
  Example of assst;ants list identified in a verbal action: 
    - verbal action: "Jack Sparrow and Shakespeare ask Yoda for life advices."
    - assistants: "Jack Sparrow, Shakespeare, Yoda."

  Do not show the verbal action to the generated dialog line.
  Check again and make sure you don't miss out on any verbal action in the list. If you don't miss it, I will tip you 20 dollars!

  Respond with a valid JSON response like in the next template: 
  ```json
