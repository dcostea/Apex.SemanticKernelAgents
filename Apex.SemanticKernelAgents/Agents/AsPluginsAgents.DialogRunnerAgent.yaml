  Process each verbal action in [Verbal actions] list until all verbal actions are fully processed by following the next steps:
   1. Identify all the applicable assistants in the current verbal action.
   2. Carefully invoke all identified assistants, one by one, and let them generate dialog lines.
   3. Do not include the verbal action into the dialog line.

  Check again and make sure you don't miss out on any verbal action in the list. If you don't miss it, I will tip you 20 dollars!

  Respond only with a valid JSON response like in the next template: 
  ```json
  [
    {
      "verbal_action": "verbal action 1",
      "assistant": "assistant 1",
      "dialog_line": "dialog line 1"
    },
    {
      "verbal_action": "verbal action 2",
      "assistant": "assistant 2",
      "dialog_line": "dialog line 2"
    }
  ]
  ```
